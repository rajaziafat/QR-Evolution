              Information about our users is an important part of our business
              and we are not in the business of selling our users’ personal
              information to others. We may transfer personal data to our
              service providers or third parties in connection with
              EvolutionQR’s operation of its business, as certain features on
              EvolutionQR rely on various third-party products and services
              (collectively “Third Party Services” ),. These third-party
              services providers only have access to certain Personal
              Information, such as your public Wallet addresses, to perform
              their functions and may not use it for other purposes.
              Furthermore, they must process the personal information in
              accordance with our contractual agreements and only as permitted
              by applicable data protections laws. Business transfers: As we
              continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy other
              businesses or services. In such transactions, user information
              generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains
              subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy notice
              (unless, of course, the user consents otherwise). Also, in the
              unlikely event that EvolutionQR or substantially all of its assets
              are acquired, users' information will be one of the transferred
              assets. We may share non-personally identifiable information
              publicly and with our partners- like publishers, advertisers,
              developers, or right holders.

              HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION WE GATHER

              We primarily use the limited information that we collect to
              enhance EvolutionQR. Except if we sell all or a portion of our
              business, or as otherwise described below, we do not rent, trade,
              or sell your Personal Information. Some ways we may use your
              Personal Information are to: Contact you when necessary; Respond
              to your comments, questions, or issues related to bugs or errors
              with EvolutionQR; Provide you with additional information; Send
              you information and marketing materials about services and
              products available through EvolutionQR, using push notifications
              or other means; Train our team members; Other internal business
              purposes. Aggregated Personal Data and Non-Personal Information We
              may share or disclose aggregated Personal Data or Non-Personal
              Information with service providers or with other persons we
              conduct business with, including but not limited potential
              third-parties for the purpose of showcasing the performance of the
              company. These service providers and other persons may also share
              with us aggregated Non-Personal Information that they have
              independently developed or acquired. Additionally, we may combine
              aggregate information from the pixel tags, and web beacons, with
              similar data we collect from other visitors to help us improve our
              Services. When doing so, we do our best to ensure that aggregated
              information cannot be linked back to you. Agents or Third-Party
              Partners We may provide your Personal Information to our
              employees, contractors, agents, service providers, and designees
              (“Agents”) to enable them to perform certain services for us,
              including improvement of website-related services and features,
              and performance of maintenance services. Business Transfers We may
              choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions,
              customer information is typically one of the business assets that
              would be transferred. Also, if we (or our assets) are acquired, or
              if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some
              other change of control, your Personal Information could be one of
              the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party. By
              accepting this Privacy Notice, as outlined above, you consent to
              any such transfer. Protection of Us and Others We will share
              personal information outside of EvolutionQR if we have a
              reasonable belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of
              the information is reasonably necessary to comply with any
              applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable
              governmental request; to cooperate with law enforcement; to
              enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements; or to

              employees, our users, or others.
